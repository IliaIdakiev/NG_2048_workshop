# Ng2048Workshop

## About
 This simple implementation of the 2048 game is intended to serve as an example for an Angular workshop that took place on 26th of March 2017. The task for this workshop was requested by students from the second [HackBulgaria Angular course](https://hackbulgaria.com/courses/angular2-volume2/) that was organized by [Ilia Idakiev](https://bg.linkedin.com/in/idakiev). This is a dynamic version of the [project](https://github.com/IliaIdakiev/NG_2048_workshop/tree/master) and was made me ([Aleksander Kostov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksander-kostov-800509105/)).
